=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an internal class and has no user-facing parts. Please do not use it.

A C<Stepford::Graph> is a directed graph of the step dependency resolution.
Each step node has connections to all of the nodes for the steps that create
its dependencies. It is a graph rather than a tree as there may be multiple
paths between a step node and steps that create dependencies of dependency
steps. It is directed as each node only knows about the nodes for its own
dependencies, not the nodes that it provides dependencies for.
