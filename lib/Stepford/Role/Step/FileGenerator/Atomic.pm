# ABSTRACT: A role for steps that generate a file atomically

__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role consumes the L<Stepford::Role::Step::FileGenerator> role. It allows
only one file production, but makes sure it is written atomically - the file
will not exist if the step aborts. The file will only be committed to its
final destination when C<run> completes successfully.

Instead of manipulating the file production directly, you work with the file
given by C<< $step->pre_commit_file >>. This role will make sure it gets
committed after C<run>.

=head1 METHODS

This role provides the following methods:

=head2 $step->BUILD

This method adds a wrapper to the BUILD method which ensures that there is
only one production.

=head2 $step->pre_commit_file

This returns a temporary file in a temporary directory that you can manipulate
inside C<run>. It will be removed if the step fails, or renamed to the final
file production if the step succeeds.

=head1 CAVEATS

When running steps in parallel, it is important to ensure that you do not call
the C<< $step->pre_commit_file >> method outside of the C<< $step->run >>
method. If you call this at object creation time, this can cause the tempdir
containing the C< pre_commit_file > file to be created and destroyed before
the run method ever gets a chance to run.
