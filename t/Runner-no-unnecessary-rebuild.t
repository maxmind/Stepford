# How this test works:
#
#   Step 1: Just creates 'file1' on disk
#   Step 2: Dependant on Step 1, create 'file2' on disk with the contents of 'file1'
#   Step 3: Dependant on Step 2, create 'file3' on disk with the contents of 'file2'
#
#  The first time through we run step 3 that creates all the files
#
#  The second time through we run things but since the files haven't changed
#  the steps aren't re-run

#  The third time through we remove 'file1' before running things.  This causes
#  last_run_time of that step to return "undef", which means it will
#  unconditionally run.
#
#  The fourth time through we touch 'file2' before running things.  Because
#  the dependency has been altered the second and third step are re-run again,
#  but the first step isn't re-run (because that hasn't changed.)

#  The fifth time though we turn on force_step_execution when running things.
#  We expect everything to be re-run because we explictly told it to
